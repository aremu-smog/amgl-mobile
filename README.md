## Introduction

üëãüèº Hi, I wanted to flex my react native muscles and see what it would entail to build a billion dollar app like [ngl](https://ngl.link).

## Tech stack

- React Native managed by Expo
- Supabase for authentication and db stuffs

## Roadmap (Things To be done)

- [x] Persist authentication (right now if you refresh the app, you are logged out)
- [x] Push Notification when someone sends a response
- [x] Implement logout
- [x] Form Validation on Login with Formik
- [x] Error on login screen (using `Alert` atm, probably something more sophisticated in the furue)
- [x] Form Validation on Signup with Formik
- [x] Error on register display (probably a toast?)
- [x] Settings Screen, allow users to set profile pictures and logout screen?
- [ ] Refactor Push Notification Approach
- [x] Rotate gradients, right now the gradients flow from top to bottom
- [ ] Share Button on the Play Screen below each option
- [x] Add temporary logout feature
- [ ] Tempoarily log users out when they have being in the background for so long.
- [ ] More will be added here...
